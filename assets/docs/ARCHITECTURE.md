# Architecture Documentation

This is an unnecessarily large documentation file that should not be bundled with the app.
It's only useful for developers during development, not for end users.

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of our Flutter application.

## Component Structure

### Frontend
- Main app widget tree
- State management with Provider
- Custom widgets and components

### Backend Integration
- REST API calls
- WebSocket connections
- Data persistence

### Performance Optimization
- Image caching
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting

## Design Patterns

We use various design patterns including:
- Singleton for app-wide services
- Factory for object creation
- Observer for state management
- Repository for data access

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Dart style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for user flows

### Deployment
- Build for release
- Test on multiple devices
- Submit to app stores
